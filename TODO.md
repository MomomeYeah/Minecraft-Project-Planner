# Project Planner
- Planned builds
- Pre-requisites (e.g. Gold farm before bartering farm)
- Build requirements (e.g. materials)
- Build priorities (which ones are most important for future builds, etc.)
- Required blocks, tools, etc.
    - Link to item database
- Photos of potential build sites, distances between sites, etc.
- Inspiration videos, build tutorials, etc.
- Collaboration tools - who will work on what

# Farm Database
- Time to build
- Different variants, with links to YouTube build guides
- Resulting items and rough quantities

# Standard Components
- Allow farms to include standard components like sorting systems with known component counts

# Item Database
- Item listings with properties
    - Tags
    - Crafting Recipes
    - Best ways to farm
- Scrape item data from somewhere convenient

# Social
- Import photos of your builds
- Allow commenting, friends lists, etc.
- Build descriptions, what went well, what you're happy with, what to improve, etc.

# General TODO Items
- Make sure ShadCN field components are being used everywhere
- Make sure table contents wrap appropriately
- Forms
    - Required fields should have indicators
    - Forms should retain entered data on validation error
    - Would be nice to show field-specific errors on login form
- SideBar
    - Hide when not logged in
    - Signout button doesn't match the styles of the rest of the sidebar items
    - Entire width of Signout should be clickable
