# Project Planner
- Planned builds
- Pre-requisites (e.g. Gold farm before bartering farm)
- Build priorities (which ones are most important for future builds, etc.)
- Required blocks, tools, etc.
    - Link to item database
- Photos of potential build sites, distances between sites, etc.
- Inspiration videos, build tutorials, etc.
- Collaboration tools - who will work on what

# Items in Stock

# Standard Components
- Allow farms to include standard components like sorting systems with known component counts

# Item Database
- Item listings with properties
    - Tags
    - Crafting Recipes
    - Best ways to farm
- Scrape item data from somewhere convenient

# Social
- Import photos of your builds
- Allow commenting, friends lists, etc.
- Build descriptions, what went well, what you're happy with, what to improve, etc.

# Farms / Builds
- use Promise / React.use functionality for builds as well as for farms
- general purpose loading skeleton for forms
- ON DELETE CASCADE
- behaviour noticed locally for farms only - sometimes on create / edit / delete, server will return successful response but no action committed
- visual loading indicator on create / edit / delete submit
- Is there a nice way to define return types for create / update without needing to specify every field?
- Farms - nicer validation message when no category selected
- UI for linked items - inputs need to be items-start, but label should be items-center

# Forms
- Required fields should have indicators
- Would be nice to show field-specific errors on login form

# SideBar
- Hide when not logged in
- Signout button doesn't match the styles of the rest of the sidebar items
- Entire width of Signout should be clickable

# General
- Make sure ShadCN field components are being used everywhere
- Make sure table contents wrap appropriately
